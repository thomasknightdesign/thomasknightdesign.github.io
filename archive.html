                    <p class="item-intro text-muted">PUSH is a fitness tech company that provides actionable data for elite coaches.</p>
                    <img class="img-fluid d-block mx-auto" src="img/App+Band.png" alt="">

                    <p>PUSH is a wearable accelerometer designed to be used in top level athletics. The wearable device is accompanied by both a mobile and desktop application that can keep track of all the data collected by the device. PUSH helps coaches quantify their athlete's outputs and stores that data for them in order to help plan and adjust future workouts.</p>
                    <br><br>
                    <h4 style="color:#fec503">My Role</h4>
                    <p>I am the UX / Product Designer at PUSH designing for both the mobile and desktop applications. My involvement would start with user stories and creating the UX flow, from there I would create wireframes and review with the development team. After the wireframes were fleshed out, I would move to the prototyping and user testing phase. After a layout is established I would move to the high fidelity design and prepare all files for our developers. I also worked on marketing, graphic design, video editing and website development for the company. </p>

                    <br><br>

                    <p>PUSH is designed around the velocity based training (VBT) philosophy.  The device measures the speed at which you can lift the barbell or perform the exercise and that number tells the coach how difficult that workout is. This helps coaches see improvements, manage injuries as well as motivate athletes.</p>

                    <h4 style="color:#fec503">Opportunities</h4>
                    <p>PUSH is targeting a niche market so there is a lot of opportunity to take over the whole market and become to number one provider for fitness tech in the space. As a designer I was always pushing to make the most usable and intuitive product in order to retain our users and push the envelope on what was possible with our product. Throughout my time at PUSH usage numbers as well as sales were consistently beating last years numbers. We spent a lot of time discussing specific use cases and issues with our users in order to cater to their experience, this provided us with a lot of insight into the strength and conditioning world.

                    <h4 style="color:#fec503">Challenges</h4>

                    <p>One of the main challenges that I had to deal with as a designer was keeping our products as intuitive as possible. A lot of coaches that we dealt with were not very technically efficient so we could not assume any functionality was obvious to the user. On top of this a lot of the athletes using the product don't experiment with it beforehand and are using it for the first time in the gym. The athlete is trying to get through their workout as quickly as possible so any barriers can quickly become an annoyance. When I was watching a full team do a complete workout while using the band it made me fully comprehend what the athletes were going through while using our product. This changed my design thinking going forward and made me prioritize a free flowing experience that tried to reduce any stoppages from the athletes.</p>

                    <h4 style="color:#fec503">Takeaways</h4>

                    <p>Working at PUSH has been a great experience to understand how a startup company works. With my time here I've had to design for pretty much every aspect of the company, which has taught me a lot about being a designer. I've learned a lot about process and found a have found a new appreciation for seeing an idea come to fruition. Working very closely with the development team has taught me a lot about collaboration and compromise. My other biggest takeaway is the importance of consistency. In the past when I've worked on shorter term projects, consistency was obvious and never seemed to be a huge issue. Working on multiple products and over a long period of time has challenged me work on my organizational skills as well as documentation. Working on the design system was a huge project and made me realize all that goes into staying consistent within a large company and the challenges you face when developing new features.</p>

                  <br><br><br><br>

                  <h4 style="color:#fec503">The Final Decision</h4>

                  <p>This graphic is able to quickly show the key components of the ring and what its purpose and functions are. I also included a mockup of the loading screen and potential prototype to make a stronger visual.</p>

                  <h4 style="color:#fec503">Persona</h4>
                  <br>
                  <p>This was the user persona developed for this concept based on some basic human factors research and surveys. Building the user persona enabled us to gain more perspective on what was important to include in the product and what was unnecessary. This also helped us develop a more cohesive marketing strategy that we could take when needed.</p>

                  <h4 style="color:#fec503">Mockups</h4>
                  <br>
                  <p>These were the mobile app screens developed to encompass all the necessary tools to use the ring. This includes a sign in page, home page, new card setup, history and settings. All of these designs were made using sketch. Mobile application design is an area where I am greatly interested in and would like to pursue further.</p>

                <p>This was an extremely rewarding project from concept to execution. Creating multiple concepts and exploring the design space in each of them was really fun. The most difficult part of this project was creating the prototypes to test the proof of concept. Having people interact with our product was a lot of fun and gave us more ideas to iterate on this design.</p>

                <h4 style="color:#fec503";>The Problem</h4>
                <br>
                <p>How can we change the overall experience of a city.</p>

                <br><br><br>
                <h4 style="color:#fec503; text-align:left;";>About</h4>
                <p style="text-align:left;";>The experience of a city is very broad so we first decided on narrowing our scope. Since the public transit system greatly impacts a person's perception of a city we decided to focus our attention there. We wanted to create a universal tool that could help modernize and improve service in cities across the world.</p>
                <br><br><br>

                <h4 style="color:#fec503; text-align:left;";>My Role</h4>
                <p style="text-align:left;";>I was the UX designer in a team of 3, researching and prototyping an application that could be implemented in the transit system. I worked on user research, personas, wireframing, prototyping and the visual design.</p>
                <br><br><br>

                <h4 style="color:#fec503; text-align:left;";>Challenges</h4>
                <p style="text-align:left;";>- Implementing an application on such a broad scale. <br> - Making a system that conforms to a large demographic <br> - Understanding what users needs and expectations are from a cities transit system. <br> - Creating a seamless experience so that we establish returning users.</p>
                <br><br><br>

                <h4 style="color:#fec503; text-align:left;";>Research</h4>
                <p style="text-align:left;";>Our first step in the research phase was to understand how the user currently flows through the system. Based off of this we wanted to focus in one one particular interaction that was a pain point. This is an experience map we created in order to visualize the users current experience.</p>
                <img class="img-fluid d-block mx-auto" src="img/dash/Dash-Presentation_Page_3.jpg" alt="">
                <br><br><br>

                <h4 style="color:#fec503; text-align:left;";>User Research</h4>
                <p style="text-align:left;";>Our next step in the research process was trying to understand our main users. We sent out surveys to get a better understanding of who would be interested in using a transit payment application and what their expectations would be. After gathering this data we put together this persona.</p>
                <img class="img-fluid d-block mx-auto" src="img/dash/Dash_UserPersona.jpg" alt="">
                <br><br><br>

                <h4 style="color:#fec503; text-align:left;";>Opportunities</h4>
                <p style="text-align:left;";>- Users can quickly move throughout the transit system seamlessly <br>- Increase the perception of the city by improving on the existing transit system. <br>- Economic gain when more tourists become attracted to the city.</p>
                <br><br><br>

                <h4 style="color:#fec503; text-align:left;";>Wireframes</h4>
                <p style="text-align:left;";>Based off our collected research and testing, I designed these initial wireframes. I wanted to make the app simple and focus on its primary purpose, payment. There are other peripheral functions but the main homescreen and focus of the app is on paying for your trip and receiving your transfer.</p>
                <img class="img-fluid d-block mx-auto" src="img/dash/Dash_Wireframes.jpg" alt="">
                <br><br><br>

                <h4 style="color:#fec503; text-align:left;";>Advantages</h4>
                <p style="text-align:left;";>These pages show how the user flows through the system as well as all the benefits for commuters and the city. We wanted to create a more seamless experience for users as well as provide an incentive for the city.
Making our project feasible and appealing to the city was a priority in this project. Giving the city valuable information about who's riding what transit and when helps the city allocate its resources appropriately.</p>

                <h4 style="color:#fec503; text-align:left;";>Mockups</h4>
                <p style="text-align:left;";>This is the screens designed for the mobile app. I took on a large role in determining how the app would be tranched and which screens were our highest priority. As well as determining related extra features that could be put into the app without burdening the users cognitive capacity. Our design offers simplicity and ease of use which was our goal when considering our demographic.</p>

                <br><br><br>

                <h4 style="color:#fec503; text-align:left;";>Conclusion</h4>
                <p style="text-align:left;";>It was difficult to design a platform that had to account for so many variables. When dealing with complex systems such as transit you have to consider all of the possible consequences and issues that might arise. On top of that the demographic is so large that you have to consider who is using this application and why. Overall this was a great learning experience as we worked together on creating the concept, solving problems and ultimately creating a final product we were proud of.</p>

                  <p class="item-intro text-muted">The sci fi chess set was an experiment to create a unique product using 3D modelling software. I decided on creating a humans vs aliens style chess set based on 1950's style sci fi movies. I made 12 original pieces that take the same role as traditional chess pieces.</p>
                  <img class="img-fluid d-block mx-auto" src="img/chess-set-renders/wholeboard2 final copy-update.jpg" alt="">
                  <p>For the alien side I wanted to use a chrome theme because it conveys the sense of an advanced industrialization. For the human side I wanted to use a matte colour with some bright highlights which was prevalent in the 1950's style.</p>

                  <img class="img-fluid d-block mx-auto" src="img/chess-set-renders/alien side final-update.jpg" alt="">
                  <img class="img-fluid d-block mx-auto" src="img/chess-set-renders/humancloseup final copy-update.jpg" alt="">
                  <p>I wanted to make the pieces of both sides comparable in functionality. The queen represents the species that is at war. The pawns are the ships sent out to be on the frontline. The rooks are designed to be spacestations that the species take refuge in or use to travel. The bishops and knights are designed to be tools that are used by the species to fight. Finally, the king is the planet that each species is trying to take control of.</p>

                  <p>Making this chess set really opened my eyes to the potential of 3D modelling. I was able to use UV mapping for both planets, getting a realistic imprint of the earth on my chess piece. I learned how to take advantage of different textures and materials to get the result I wanted. I had fun modelling these pieces and gained great insights into the world of 3D modelling.</p>

                        <h4 style="color:#fec503">Opportunities</h4>

                        <p>Customers can visually see their food before they place their order
                          <br>
                          Marketing opportunities for restaurants to attract customers
                          <br>
                          Food and beverage industry would be caught up with technology
                          <br>
                          Eating out would be a new experience for customers
                          <br>
                          Customers are more informed on the ingredients in the menu dishes</p>

                        <h4 style="color:#fec503">Interaction Focus</h4>
                        <p>The main interaction that really sells the experience for our users is the "wow" factor they will have when they initially see the menu appear. We want to make this interaction as exciting and aesthetically pleasing as possible. This involves experimenting with various layouts and modelling techniques to see how we can display them at 1:1 scale while still being accessible by the user. We want the user to explore the menu right after this product, looking in at each item with wonder and intrigue. Getting this initial interaction correct will really increase the amount of time spent using our app.</p>

                          <p>After creating the visual wireframes, we received feedback that the current path we were going towards was just a normal application that had an added function of AR. Our end goal was to enhance the dining out experience with augmented reality not with an ordering application. We took all the received feedback and tested the way how the user will view the food in a real scenario by using paper prototyping and our mobile phone's camera.</p>

                          <h4 style="color:#fec503">Prototyping</h4>
                          <p>We had to adapt our original idea of developing a single full table menu for the entire group, to a menu per person model. When we laid out our food models across the whole table we realized that the distance across the table was too far for people to view the entire menu. With a menu per person model, we wanted to have an AR marker installed in front of every seat so that they can see everything easily. This model allows for more control on the positioning of the items and ensures the experience is the same for every customer.</p>

                  <h4>Category: Concept Design / 3D Rendering / Product Design</h4>
                  <p class="item-intro text-muted">A multi faceted design encompassing urban planning, engineering, sound design and development. A concept on how to revitalize a city in decline. The driving force behind the design being public spaces. Public spaces represent the current state of a city, the mood of the people. It should reflect on the culture and be significant to the community. Cities become known for their monuments, parks and museums; where everyone has the opportunity to experience them.</p>

                  <h4 style="color:#fec503">The Problem</h4>
                  <p>Detroit suffers from a pervasive stigma that has crippled progress and growth within the city. This affects the mentality of the citizens and detracts tourists from visiting.</p>
                  <br>
                  <img class="img-fluid d-block mx-auto" src="img/Detroit-Reboot/Detroit_Reboot_FINALV2 (1)_Page_03.jpg" alt="">
                  <br><br><br>
                  <h4 style="color:#fec503">The Solution</h4>
                  <p>Change the way Detroit is perceived. Despite all the obstacles, Detroit is a canvas with many opportunities. We wanted to communicate this message through a series of interactive art installations distributed across the city. Giving all citizens the opportunity to become involved and feel connected with their city. </p>

                  <br><br><br>
                  <h4 style="color:#fec503">The Current Status</h4>
                  <p>These are the obstacles that currently exist in the city and conversely all the advantages that would help further our ideas</p>
                  <br>

                  <br><br><br>

                  <h4 style="color:#fec503">How it Works</h4>
                  <p>We chose to focus in on one particular exhibit that we would install in Detroit, The Hub. Detroit musicians create their own music based on Detroit heritage but filtered through their own creative process. The hub is a platform to promote artists and raise awareness of the rising art culture. It connects people and artists in a public space. </p>

                  <br><br><br>

                  <h4 style="color:#fec503">What it Would Look Like</h4>
                  <p>This is a 3D rendering of what we imagined The Hub to look like.</p>

                  <br><br><br>

                  <h4 style="color:#fec503">Precedents</h4>
                  <p>Exploring the history of other cities, we noticed a pattern. Places with bad reputations attracted artists seeking low rental properties. Artists are intrigued to  move and become a part of Detroit. These are other cities that saw a similar transformation.</p>

                  <br><br><br>

                  <h4 style="color:#fec503">The Process</h4>
                  <p>Detroit is already in the process of revitalization. Utilizing art and sustainable resources the turn around in this city has already begun. The benefits of art in a failing city can be unbelievable.</p>
                  <br>

                  <h4 style="color:#fec503">Conclusion</h4>
                  <p>Designing a project aimed at rejuvenating a specific city was difficult but rewarding. The concepts on this project spanned many different industrial sectors. Focusing in on public spaces and the image of a city seemed like the most feasible and interesting idea. Public spaces really have a huge impact on citizens perception and I hope to continue working on similar projects.</p>
